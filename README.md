ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a Machine Learning and Deep Learning enthusiast with hands-on experience building intelligent systems for real-world problems.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™ve developed end-to-end AI projects including:
- Brain tumor detection from MRI scans using convolutional neural networks.
- Real-time sign language recognition and speech translation.
- Object detection and tracking systems using deep learning.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems with AI, especially in the fields of medical imaging, computer vision, and human-computer interaction.

ðŸ§  Core Skills:
- Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Computer Vision
- Python, C/C++, JavaScript, Ruby
- Libraries & Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

ðŸ”§ I also have a solid background in:
- Networks (CCNA, CCNP)
- Cybersecurity (CEH certified)
- Arduino & Raspberry Pi Projects
- Front-end and Desktop Application Development

ðŸ“‚ I'm currently building and sharing open-source AI projects here. Stay tuned for more!
